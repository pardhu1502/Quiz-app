## Project Overview

Quiz‑App is a web application for creating, managing, and taking quizzes. It allows users (or administrators) to define questions, store them in a database, present quizzes to users through a web interface, and evaluate responses. The project includes backend logic (controllers, models) and frontend views to deliver a full user experience.

---

## Features

- Admin / controller endpoints to create, update, delete quiz questions.  
- Models to represent quiz data / users / responses.  
- Views to display quiz questions and collect answers.  
- Routing to serve different pages / endpoints.  
- Basic frontend UI (using CSS / EJS templating) to render quizzes.  

---

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js** with **Express.js** for the server side.  
- **EJS** for server‑side templating of views.  
- **JavaScript** for backend logic and any frontend interactivity.  
- **CSS** for styling.  
- Some folder structure including controllers, models, routes, views.
